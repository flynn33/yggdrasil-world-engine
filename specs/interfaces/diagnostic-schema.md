# Diagnostic Schema — canonical specification (Canonical Baseline)

## Purpose

This specification defines the **shared diagnostic envelope** used across all diagnostic contexts in the ASH Pattern System.

Every diagnostic record produced by the system — whether for state validity, recovery, fallback, containment, or safe halt — must conform to this schema. This ensures that the full diagnostic chain from initial detection through terminal halt is structurally consistent, auditable, and machine-readable.

This schema is **canonical** (Design Package D). Downstream implementation repositories must not invent local diagnostic structures.

## Shared diagnostic envelope

```text
TYPE DiagnosticEnvelope
    diagnostic_kind          : DiagnosticKind
    severity                 : Severity
    stage                    : Stage
    disposition              : Disposition
    subject_reference        : reference to the state, action, or entity being diagnosed
    parent_diagnostic_reference : DiagnosticEnvelope or NONE
    chain_root_reference     : DiagnosticEnvelope or NONE
    rule_ids                 : List of String (must conform to rule-id-taxonomy.md)
    summary                  : String (one-line human-readable summary)
    notes                    : List of String (detailed human-readable annotations)
END TYPE
```

## Diagnostic kind conventions

```text
ENUM DiagnosticKind
    STATE_VALIDITY           -- produced by state-validity diagnosis
    RECOVERY                 -- produced by correction or re-derivation actions
    FALLBACK                 -- produced by fallback selection
    CONTAINMENT              -- produced by containment entry or management
    SAFE_HALT                -- produced by safe-halt entry
END ENUM
```

Every diagnostic must declare exactly one kind. The kind determines which specification governs the diagnostic content.

## Severity conventions

```text
ENUM Severity
    INFO                     -- normal operation, no action required
    WARNING                  -- condition detected, action may be required
    ERROR                    -- condition requires recovery or escalation
    CRITICAL                 -- condition requires containment or safe halt
END ENUM
```

Severity must reflect the actual system impact, not the diagnostic source. A `STATE_VALIDITY` diagnostic may be `ERROR` if the state is inadmissible, or `INFO` if the state is stable.

## Stage conventions

```text
ENUM Stage
    DETECTION                -- initial detection of a condition (state-validity diagnosis)
    CLASSIFICATION           -- system-state classification and recoverability mapping
    RECOVERY                 -- correction, re-derivation, or fallback selection
    ESCALATION               -- escalation from recovery to containment
    TERMINAL                 -- safe halt (no further stages)
END ENUM
```

Stages are monotonically ordered. A diagnostic at stage `ESCALATION` must have a parent at stage `RECOVERY` or `CLASSIFICATION`. A diagnostic at stage `TERMINAL` must have a parent at stage `ESCALATION` or `RECOVERY`.

## Disposition conventions

```text
ENUM Disposition
    RESOLVED                 -- the condition was resolved (e.g., correction succeeded)
    PENDING                  -- the condition is awaiting resolution (e.g., containment awaiting operator)
    BLOCKED                  -- the condition cannot proceed (e.g., malformed input)
    ESCALATED                -- the condition was escalated to a more severe stage
    TERMINAL                 -- the system has halted; no further disposition changes
END ENUM
```

## Chaining requirements

Diagnostics form a **chain** from initial detection through terminal halt:

1. **`parent_diagnostic_reference`** — links to the immediately preceding diagnostic in the chain. The root diagnostic (typically a `STATE_VALIDITY` diagnostic at stage `DETECTION`) has `parent_diagnostic_reference = NONE`.

2. **`chain_root_reference`** — links to the originating diagnostic at the root of the chain. Every diagnostic in a chain shares the same `chain_root_reference`. This enables reconstruction of the full chain from any point.

3. **Chain integrity** — every diagnostic except the root must have a non-NONE `parent_diagnostic_reference`. Every diagnostic must have a non-NONE `chain_root_reference` (which equals itself for the root).

4. **No orphan diagnostics** — a diagnostic must not exist without a chain. Even a standalone `STATE_VALIDITY` diagnostic for a `STABLE` state must set its `chain_root_reference` to itself.

## Rule-ID requirements

1. Every diagnostic must include at least one `rule_id` in its `rule_ids` list.
2. All `rule_id` values must conform to the canonical pattern defined in `specs/interfaces/rule-id-taxonomy.md`.
3. Rule-free diagnostics are prohibited. If a diagnostic cannot cite a specific rule, it must cite a catch-all rule from the appropriate family (e.g., `ASH-STATE-GENERAL-001`).

## Explanation requirements

1. The `summary` field must contain a one-line human-readable summary of the diagnostic.
2. The `notes` list must contain at least one entry explaining the condition, action taken, or reason for the disposition.
3. Empty summaries and empty notes lists are prohibited.

## Deterministic output expectations

1. The same input conditions must always produce the same diagnostic output (same kind, severity, stage, disposition, rule_ids, and summary).
2. Notes may vary in non-semantic detail (e.g., timestamps) but must convey the same diagnostic meaning for the same conditions.
3. Diagnostic output must not depend on randomness, external state, or platform-specific behavior.

## Prohibition on silent omission

1. Every step in the recovery/escalation chain must produce a diagnostic record. No step may be silently skipped.
2. If a step completes without producing a diagnostic, the implementation is nonconformant.
3. Silent escalation (changing severity or stage without emitting a diagnostic) is prohibited.
4. Diagnostics must not be deferred, batched, or conditionally suppressed.

## Relation to other specifications

- **state-validity-diagnostics.pseudo.md** — produces `STATE_VALIDITY` diagnostics conforming to this schema
- **recovery-fallback-semantics.pseudo.md** — produces `RECOVERY` and `FALLBACK` diagnostics conforming to this schema
- **containment-safe-failure-semantics.pseudo.md** — produces `CONTAINMENT` and `SAFE_HALT` diagnostics conforming to this schema
- **rule-id-taxonomy.md** — governs the `rule_ids` field
- **semantic-contracts.md** — requires downstream implementations to expose diagnostics conforming to this schema
- **fallback-policy-registry.md** — fallback diagnostics must reference the registry policy_id
